# Grow Controller

## Quick Overview

The Grow Controller uses a Raspberry Pi to run a custom-built board with a temperature and humidity sensor. It sits by your tent, and the sensor connects inside. This means you can easily glance at the display on the board to check the temperature and humidity readings without needing to unzip the tent or disrupt your setup.

I chose a Raspberry Pi over an Arduino because it lets me have a Database and Webserver all in one. Plus, it comes with a small WiFi dongle, so you can reach its webserver anywhere in your house.
